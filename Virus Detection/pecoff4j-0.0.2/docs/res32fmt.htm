</p><p>

<b>Preface</b><br>
Welcome to the Win32 Resource File Format reference guide !<br>
This document is a guide to reading/writing Windows 95 and Windows NT resource files (RES extension).<br>
This guide has been written by <a href="mailto:d3k@mdnet.it">M.Cocco</a> (of <a href="http://www.mdlive.com/d3k/">d3k - The Artisan Of Ware</a>, Italy) while developing the 
MakeRes Resource Editor, a tool of the "Photoshop Plug-in Toolkit" for Delphi 2.0. <br>

<b>Audience</b><br>
This guide is for any programmers who have written applications for
Windows systems and wish to understand how to work with standalone
binary resource file (RES files, not in-EXE resources).
This guide assumes you are proficient in the Windows programming and
have worked in any development environments such as Borland Delphi 2.0,
Borland Delphi 3.0, Borland C++ Builder, Microsoft Visual C++ (on
Windows 95 or Windows NT).<br>
You should have a working knowledge of the different resource types,
and understand how handle binary files. This guide assumes you
understand terminology such as records (structures), WORD and DWORD
types, strings (ANSI and UNICODE), record (structure) alignment, etc. </p><p>

<b>Remarks</b><br>
This documentation is made to provide specific information on
implementation and structuring issues for Win32 resource files only.
Win16 resource files
are not explained in this guide.<br>
The best way to use this guide is to read it all without skipping any chapter.<br>
<br>
Should you have any question, feel free to contact the author.

<b><font size="+1">GETTING STARTED</font></b>

</p><p>
This document details the structure of the resource binary file (.RES)
format for Win32 platforms (W95 and WNT). The structure is very similar
to the existing Win16 (W3/W3.1/3.11) structure, but it supports some
new data types and data structures.<br>
One important enhancement is the DWORD/WORD alignment of
structures/fields which increases performance of new 32 bit
microprocessors but
makes resource reading/writing a bit more complex (structures are of
dynamic size). The order of the fields of resource data structures is
not changed due to alignment, but some padding is required between
fields.<br>
<br>
The Win32 resource file contains one or more binary resources merged in
a single file and aligned on DWORD boundaries. Each resource has its
own
header structure followed by resource data. Immediately after the
resource data comes the header for the next resource followed by
resource data, and so on.<br>
<br>
To read/write resource files you must have knowledge of binary files
handling. Resource files cannot be read using text mode file routines.<br>
<br>


</p><p>

<b><font size="+1">THE RESOURCE HEADER</font></b>

- Resource header structure is not of fixed length. <b>You have to read/write header fields one at a time.</b><br>
- Resource headers ever start on a DWORD boundary.<br>
- When reading a RES file you must move the file pointer to next
nearest DWORD boundary (only if current file pointer is not already on
a DWORD boundary).<br>
- When writing a RES file you must write as much padding bytes as it is
required to let the header be DWORD aligned (only if current file
pointer is not already on a DWORD boundary).<br>

	The size of the data that follows the header. This value does not include any file padding bytes added after the actual data.<br>

	<td>
	HeaderSize
	</td>

	The size of the resource  header structure. This value <b>includes </b>the size of the DataSize and HeaderSize fields.<br>

The ResType field is an array of UNICODE characters (a string)

after the terminating NULL to make next field (ResName) start on a
DWORD boundary.<br>
	<br><b>CORRECTION:</b> From Microsoft's documentation:<br>
	<i>You do not need to add padding for DWORD alignment between the TYPE and
NAME members because they contain WORD data. However, you may need to add a
WORD of padding after the NAME member to align the rest of the header on
DWORD boundaries.</i><br>

	If your application is not using the set of UNICODE API calls you have to convert the resource name to ANSI encoding.<br>

</p><p>

<b>Language IDs</b><br>
<br>
The LanguageID field, included in each resource header, specifies the
language that the strings (of String Tables and Message Tables) are
written with.<br>
The system must be informed of the language because it needs to know
how to convert characters from UNICODE to ANSI (from double-byte to
single-byte characters).<br>
<br>
The LanguageID field (found in any resource header) if a 16 bin
unsigned integer (WORD) containing not only the language ID but also a
sub-language ID. The lower 10 bits
(bits 0-9) of this value contain the LanguageID, remaining bits contain
the SubLanguageID (bits 11-15).<br>
The LanguageID specifies the code of the primary language. The
SubLanguageID specifies a variation of the primary language (a dialect).<br>
